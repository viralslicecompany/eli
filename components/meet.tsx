                Eli is a life coach, entrepreneur, and certified Aspire Tour
                speaker who's passionate about helping people close the gap
                between where they are now and where they want to be.

                After hitting rock bottom through self-destructive patterns
                rooted in negative mental programming, Eli made the decision to
                transform his life. He learned to identify and reframe the
                limiting beliefs holding him back, eventually building a startup
                from the ground up into a multi-million dollar company with over
                40 employees.

              <span className="block">
                But here's what he discovered: business success alone wasn't
                enough. Despite achieving everything he thought he wanted,
                something was missing. That realization led him to his true
                callingâ€”helping others break through their own barriers and find
                genuine fulfillment.

                His upcoming book, <span className="italic">Rewrite The Program</span>, lays out a
                transformative framework that walks readers through
                understanding their childhood programming, navigating the
                necessary unlearning process, and amplifying their authentic
                voice to make a real impact.
